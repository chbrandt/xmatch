    "# Cross-matching astronomical catalogs\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-matching is the process of finding entries (objects) in two or more tables (catalogs) considered, in reality, to be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for a longer explanation, consider two astronomical catalogs -- where rows contain properties of  astronomical objects, columns organize those properties and each (real) astronomical object can be present no more than once in each catalog. To picture a very simple situation, without loosing in generality, ee can think of such catalogs as being the products of optical and x-ray observations of a certain region of the sky. It it is expected -- say the *null-hypothesis* -- that not all but some of the objects are in both catalogs. Notice, though, that the catalogs -- as data structures -- are not required to share any other structural property like number or order of rows and columns. This is a typical scenario astronomers handle a cross-matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of finding the objects shared by both catalogs is called cross-matching. In extra-galactic astronomy, in practice the objects -- galaxies, QSOs -- do not move; which brings their position in the sky to be used as an identifier. The very basic parameters to be used for the cross-matching is then Right Ascension and Declination: at each of those catalogs, the objects that are in the same position of the sky are said to be the same. The result of this process is a *cross-matched* catalog, containing the matched objects and the merge of columns (*i.e.*, properties) from both catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it looks like a simple subject, cross-matching is a long-standing issue in astronomy. And it is quite easy to see that once we realize how observational effects (*e.g.*, astronomical seeing) affect, for instance, an object's position measurement. The uncertainties added to the measurements cause the same object to show up slightly different positions in each catalog; given that we have to match not exact values, but coordinates that should match within a tolerance value |egr| -- also called *error radius*  or *search radius*. Intrinsic astrophysical effects can also cause the same astronomical object not to match between catalogs of different wavebands, for example, Radio Lobes generated by an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can cause a mismatch between a radio and an optical catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the basic idea on cross-matching is to associate the closest sources within a search radius. Which is called a *pure positional* method. Other two association methods can be found in the literature, *maximum likelihood* [SeS92]_ and *bayesian statistics* [BeS08]_.\n",

    "## Nearest Neighbor algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm implement for cross-matching catalogs is based on a *nearest neighbor* search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two mock catalogs\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two catalogs **A**, **B**. The algorithm does a two-way search, first taking catalog *A* as the *reference catalog* and searching for the nearest neighbor(NN) in *B* (*B->A*), then for the NN of *B* in *A* (*A->B*). Because there can be multiple matches with the same NN (different sources in *A* can have the same object in *B* as NN, when *B->A* for example) a cleaning step is necessary to remove this multiplicity. Such cleaning is done by keeping only the pair of objects (*i.e.*, match) that exist on both matching lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Figure 1`_ illustrates a spatial distribution of objects from two different catalogs -- *A*,*B*. This image should help us in visualizing the matching algorithm. The size of the circles symbolizes the *error radius* on object positions, they all measure ``20 pixels``.\n",

    "The search for neighbors\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for the nearest neighbor to the objects in catalog *A* we find the objects in *B* as listed on the  table `Matching (NN) B->A`_ below. On the other hand, looking for the NN in the other direction, *B* as reference and looking for neighbors in *A*, we have the matches shown in `Matching (NN) A->B`_. As we might already been expecting, multiple objects were found from the second (\"neighborhood\") catalog to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is to clean those multiplicities. Going through the *multiple matches* given from both tables we should agree that the real *nearest neighbors* are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **B->A**: [A:3,B:1], [A:7,B:4], [A:4,B:2], [A:12,B:5]\n",
    "* **A->B**: [B:2,A:4]\n",
    "\n",
    "That is to say that all other multiple matches should be taken out. Doing such, we end up with `Table 3`_, where separation (in pixels) are shown, where indeed only those 4 matchings-pairs are kept for the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, though, that we are not get into the question whether the matches are right or wrong; not yet. The current discussion regards only the a search for a unique set of *nearest neighbors* pairs as a basic idea to establish before going further on qualifying those matches.\n",
